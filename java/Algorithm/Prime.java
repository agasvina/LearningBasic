"How do you find the number of divisor for this particular number n?"
"How to check if a number is a prime number?"
"How do you find the find all the prime numbers that is less x?"

For the first and second questions:
One of the solutions which takes a complexity of O(N) is as follow:
	iterate i  from 1 to n, 
	modulo n by  i, if the result is 0 then i is the divisor of n

However, there is a unique solution which only take O(n^0.5)..
if a number n is divide by i, itâ€™s also can be divided by n/i.
In that case we can simply check the number from 1 to the root of n (n^0.5) 
because  (n^0.5) * (n^0.5) = n. Therefore, if you do the modulo 
operation of n by i and the result is 0, you have two divisor for n.
